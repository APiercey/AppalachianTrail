      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>The Appalachian Trail Conservancy upholds the highest standards for the protection 
      and management of the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) to ensure that it can be shared and 
      enjoyed well into the future.</p>

      <img src="" alt="">

      <p>Due to the Trail’s historic legacy of volunteerism, many of the ATC’s programs 
      are focused on supporting and encouraging volunteers. We work cooperatively with volunteer 
      A.T. clubs and agencies to develop meaningful Trail policies, share expertise on trail 
      design and construction, and protect the landscapes and natural and cultural resources 
      that represent the unique, inspiring, and oftentimes life changing, experience of the A.T.</p>

      <p>Our newer initiatives help us reach out to the next generation of A.T. supporters and 
      visitors through education and outreach programs. As we work to steward the valuable lands 
      that the A.T. traverses, we are eager to ensure those protected lands remain relevant and 
      available to all those seeking recreation and solitude on the Trail.</p>
